        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>I'm an Arizona born convert to the keyboard cult. After three years working toward med school, I realized that my fingers crave the keys not the calipers. I've always been an avid computer hobbyists and now I'm ready to go pro!</p>
        
        <h2>Projects:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I co-coded and single-handedly designed a twitchy action game on the Crayta platform</li>
            <li>I programmed for temperature diagnostics in lab equipment as part of a collaborative project (aka pair programming in CS142, (-; )</li>
            <li>In fifth grade, I used google and the command line to change permissions on my school's student file network, shutting out the administration and IT department until the entire system was reset at the end of the semester. In the interim, a classmate and I wrote and dispersed over the student network a plethora of annoying but harmless programs that would make the monitor flash or continuously pop disc drives in and out.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Experience:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Habilitation Therapy Provider, <em>Arion Healthcare Solutions</em><br/>2017-present</li>
            <li>Head Operating Room Technician/Medical Scribe, <em>Nexus Paincare Specialists</em><br/>2019-2021</li>
        </ul>
