//Hey! Here's some of the information I've found and plan to use.

// Use API's:
// https://calendarific.com/holidays/2021/us
//      Remove filler words:
//          for, of, day, global, world, to, international, in, against, last, (Sunday, monday, etc.), the,
//      Grab first two words
//      Show pictures/urls for all upcoming holidays. Set option to specify date.
//
// https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api
// https://www.boredapi.com/


//With these API's, we'll have a user specify a date (default = that day). We'll return a holiday to observe, a recipe generated by holiday title as keywords for EDAMAM API, and then use the boredapi to generate a random suggested way to celebrate.
//On days with no holiday, the generator will present the closest holiday.
//Many days have more than one holiday, so it might be beneficial to present a specified number of the soonest approaching holidays, each with their own recipe and suggested activity.
//
//We could, of course, add more qualifiers for each of the API's, but these should start us with a good layout.
//
//I've looked over all of the api's pretty in depth. Hopefully by the time you get back onto the project, I'll have them implemented pretty well.
