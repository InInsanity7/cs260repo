Vim seems to be a very powerful editor. I like the potentially rapid rate at which a large file can be navigated and edited. Especially in a file containing code, vim's navigational features seem optimal for navigating vertically across lines of code. I can imagine myself having a lot of trouble getting used to the split interface (edit vs. insert). Additionally, I don't love that the immense bank of features possible through vim makes learning it almost like learning a whole new coding language! However, I do think learning vim will be worth the payoff. I expect to gain a good deal of command line code-editing productivity from my time spent learning it.

Now I'm just testing out features!
